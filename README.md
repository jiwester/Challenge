# Gambit coding challenge
This is my take on gambit's coding challenge. I chose Option 2, which is to create a web app that retrieves and parses data from the backend in the form of a .txt file and presents it in the frontend.

## Implementation
I used php for parising the data file, then the parsed data is sent to the frontend in JSON format and the data is finally presented in a jQuery data table. The user can quickly find specific data by either searching or sorting the table. Bootstrap was used in the frontend to make the website responsive and JetBrains PhpStorm IDE was used for development of the project.

## [Demo](https://it-teaching-abo-akademi.github.io/csdewas-project-1-jiwester/Challenge/html/index.html)
This is a static demo of the website containing the 25 first rows of data. The implementation is dynamic, but hosting a dynamic website proved to be quite a challenge. To properly test the website, pull this project and open it in a development environment, for example XAMPP or PhpStorm, then run/preview index.php.
