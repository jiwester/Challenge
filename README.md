# Gambit coding challenge

This is my take on gambit's coding challenge. I chose Option 2, which was to create a web app that retrieves and parses a .txt file from the backend and presents it in the frontend.

## Implementation
I used php for getting and parising the data file, then the parsed data is sent to the frontend in JSON format and the data is finally presented in a jQuery data table. Bootstrap was used in the frontend to make the website responsive. I used the JetBrains PhpStorm IDE for development.

## Demo
This is a static demo of the website. The whole implementation is dynamic, but hosting a dynamic website proved to be quite a challenge. To run the full dynamic website, pull this project and open it in a development environment, for example XAMPP or PhpStorm, then run index.php.
